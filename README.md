# Brain-Tumor-Detection-
Brain Tumor Detection uses deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify MRI brain scans and identify the presence of tumors. The model is trained on labeled medical images, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor cases, aiding in faster and more reliable diagnosis.
